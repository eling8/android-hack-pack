3. Configure Android Studio
- (Mac OS X only) If you are using Mac OS X Yosemite and the latest Java v1.8, your computer might be unable to launch Android Studio. If so, see this StackOverflow thread for a fix (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27369269/android-studio-was-unable-to-find-a-valid-jvm-related-to-mac-os)

- Click Install X packages button at bottom-right.

4. Creating a new project
(See https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/create-project.html#CreatingAProject for more information)
- Click “Start a new Android Studio project” to select settings, names, and activities (defaults are okay)
- Choose your API level to determine the lowest Android level your app can run on. 
- Develop your app using the .java and .xml files in Android Studio. Switch between file types using the tabs on top, and switch between design and text views for .xml files using the tabs at the bottom.

5. Running an app
- Click the play button at the top of Android Studio
- Select the emulator device you want to use and click OK
